    <h2>Fenner House</h2>



    <p>The Fenner House, at 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill, is located within the Red Hill heritage precinct. It was designed by Robin Boyd in 1952–53 for Professor and Mrs Frank Fenner, and built by Karl Schreiner in 1953-54.</p>

    <p> Professor Frank Fenner AC, CMG, MBE, FAA (21 December 1914 – 22 November 2010) was one of Australia’s leading virologists, noted for his work on myxomatosis and smallpox, and has won three of the world’s most prestigious awards: the Albert Einstein World Award for Science (August 2000), the Japan Prize for preventative medicine and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (London).</p>

    <p> The Fenner House represents a simple, bold, well planned and designed house that appropriately integrates the building with the corner block, set in a garden designed by important Canberra landscape architect Professor Lindsay Pryor. The design of the house was unique and advanced in Canberra at the time and is a significant work of Robin Boyd, a prominent Australian architect.</p>

    <h2>Eltringham House</h2>

    <p> The Eltringham House at 12 Marawa Place, Aranda is a three bedroom house designed by Robin Boyd in 1968–69. Construction was completed in 1970–71. Aranda is characterised by its native landscape setting, being located near large tracts of native bushland at the Black Mountain and Aranda Bushland Canberra Nature Parks. The house has similarities to the late twentieth century Sydney and Adelaide regional styles of architecture.</p>

    <p> 12 Marawa Place, Aranda is listed on the ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. It is regarded by the AIA as being important because it is an example of significant architecture and is a valuable educational resource, having a strong association with Robin Boyd, one of Australia’s leading architects of the modern movement.</p>
